# The Open Source LabVIEW Icon Editor

Just recently, the LabVIEW Icon Editor has been made open source to encourage collaboration between NI and the LabVIEW Community. Every new build of LabVIEW will grab the icon editor that has been pushed into the `main` branch from this repo.

The direction of the LabVIEW Icon Editor and which new features are added, and which are left out, is decided by the steering committee, which includes NI staff and LabVIEW community volunteers (sometimes referred to as a ‚Äúcathedral‚Äù style of development).

That being said, the Icon Editor is great because of the LabVIEW users who use it, share their code with the community, and discuss ways to make LabVIEW even better. Some of the most important and undervalued work in open source is from non-code contributions, and that is where we can use the most help from you.

# Our Contributing Philosophy

This repo is managed via [git](https://git-scm.com), with the canonical upstream repository hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/ni/labview-icon-editor) and it follows a pull-request model for development.

Feature requests are selected by NI in a joint effort with a group of members of the LabVIEW community called a "steering committee". A steering committee is a group of trusted individuals selected by the software community lead based on their background and contribution history to the NI ecosystem.

Steering committees are non-NI employees with triage roles to the repo that can vote on community driven features being part of the next LabVIEW release.

## Comment on GitHub discussions

[GitHub discussions](https://github.com/ni/labview-icon-editor/discussions) are raw ideas in the process of gathering feedback from the community before converting them into a GitHub issue. Go to the GitHub discussions and voice your opinion on ideas that will eventually be a part of the next shipping version of the Icon Editor.

# Enhancements

If you have an idea or suggestion for an enhancement to the LabVIEW Icon Editor library, please use the [New Features](https://github.com/ni/labview-icon-editor/discussions/categories/new-features) discussion section. **please make sure to start a discussion about your changes.** The direction of the LabVIEW Icon Editor and which new features are added are discussed in our Discord Server and in [this GitHub discussions section](https://github.com/ni/labview-icon-editor/discussions/categories/new-features), and in the end, they are decided by the core team.

Talking to us first via the discussions section about the enhancement you want to build will be the most likely way to get your pull request into the library (see Our Contributing Philosophy above). We would hate to see you write code you‚Äôre proud of, just to learn that we‚Äôve already been working on the same thing, or that we feel doesn‚Äôt fit into the core library.

Once your idea has been selected for the next release of LabVIEW, a branch will be created that you can submit your pull request to.

# Creating a discussion for a new feature

The first step to start an enhancement to the icon editor is to create a discussion on the [New Features](https://github.com/ni/labview-icon-editor/discussions/categories/new-features) discussion board. You must describe the problem that made you want to have this enhancement.

# The Open Source LabVIEW Icon Editor

Just recently, the LabVIEW Icon Editor has been made open source to encourage collaboration between NI and the LabVIEW Community. Every new build of LabVIEW will grab the icon editor that has been pushed into the `main` branch from this repo.

The direction of the LabVIEW Icon Editor and which new features are added, and which are left out, is decided by the steering committee, which includes NI staff and LabVIEW community volunteers (sometimes referred to as a “cathedral” style of development).

That being said, the Icon Editor is great because of the LabVIEW users who use it, share their code with the community, and discuss ways to make LabVIEW even better. Some of the most important and undervalued work in open source is from non-code contributions, and that is where we can use the most help from you.

# Our Contributing Philosophy

This repo is managed via [git](https://git-scm.com), with the canonical upstream repository hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/ni/labview-icon-editor) and it follows a pull-request model for development.

Feature requests are selected by NI in a joint effort with a group of members of the LabVIEW community called a "steering committee". A steering committee is a group of trusted individuals selected by the software community lead based on their background and contribution history to the NI ecosystem.

Steering committees are non-NI employees with triage roles to the repo that can vote on community driven features being part of the next LabVIEW release.

## Comment on GitHub discussions

[GitHub discussions](https://github.com/ni/labview-icon-editor/discussions) are raw ideas in the process of gathering feedback from the community before converting them into a GitHub issue. Go to the GitHub discussions and voice your opinion on ideas that will eventually be a part of the next shipping version of the Icon Editor.

## Create a GitHub discussion

Want things done differently? or have an idea on a feature that is not ready yet to be considered as a GitHub issue?

Create a [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/ni/labview-icon-editor/discussions/new/choose) so that other member of the LabVIEW community can weigh in on your dicsussion. Discussions are usually initial stage for GitHub issues.

<a name="reportanissue" />

## Report an issue

Found an issue? [raise a new GitHub issue](https://github.com/ni/labview-icon-editor/issues/new/choose) and select "Bug Report"

## Develop features and bugfixes with NI and the LabVIEW community

 You can do this by becoming a contributor.

Contributions for bug resolution and feature development have certain guidelines and processes not covered on this document. More information can be found [here](https://github.com/ni/labview-icon-editor/wiki).

* ## Feature development

Try developing a new feature by going into the GitHub issues labeled as [Workflow: Open to contribution](https://github.com/ni/labview-icon-editor/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20label%3A%22Workflow%3A%20Open%20to%20contribution%22). Go to the GitHub issue you want to work on, and let us know via a comment.

* ## Solve a bug

Go to the GitHub issues marked as bugs that are open for contribution [here](https://github.com/ni/labview-icon-editor/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20label%3A%22Workflow%3A%20Open%20to%20contribution%22%20type%3ABug).

# Enhancements

If you have an idea or suggestion for an enhancement to the LabVIEW Icon Editor library, please use the [New Features](https://github.com/ni/labview-icon-editor/discussions/categories/new-features) discussion section. **please make sure to start a discussion about your changes.** 

Talking to us first via the discussions section about the enhancement you want to build will be the most likely way to get your pull request into the library (see Our Contributing Philosophy above). We would hate to see you write code you’re proud of, just to learn that we’ve already been working on the same thing, or that we feel doesn’t fit into the core library.

Once your idea has been selected for the next release of LabVIEW, a branch will be created that you can submit your pull request to.
